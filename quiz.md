___
**Instructions**

Hello, congratulations and thank you for taking part in this Internal Training on Ridge and LASSO Regression. To test your abilities about Ridge and LASSO Regression concepts and techniques.
___
 
1. Under this type of Regression that is NOT a regularization technique is:

- [ ] Ordinary Least Square Regression
- [ ] Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Regression

<br>

2. Benefits of Regression Regulations include, EXCEPT:

- [ ] can overcome the problem of multicollinearity
- [ ] Reduces the value of bias in the train data
- [ ] Overcoming the Problem of Overfitting

<br>

___
**Instructions for number 3-6**
Use data.csv which gives data `crime`. Make an inequality prediction based on all remaining variables. Split data train with the top 30 data. and for best lambda use set.seed (100)
